						<p>You can submit any manifestation of your art – whether that’s a photo you took, a photo you took of something you made, or even a Word document containing a short story or poem. Just double-check specs and file types before submitting.</p>
						<p>You’re welcome to apply every and any month you like (please do!) but we ask that you only submit one piece of work per month.</p>
						<p>Voting will be conducted the first week of every month by a jury within the Juliet agency, judging all the submitted work from the month before. We’ll hum and haw over each piece’s originality, aesthetic, and message when deciding who the recipient of the homepage space – and the $2500 grant – will be. Shortly after the judging process, we’ll contact the recipient of the month via email.</p>
